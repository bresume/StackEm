# StackEm

**StackEm** is a command-line tool that analyzes `.utrace` profiling files from Unreal Engine using OpenAI's GPT-4 API. It helps you identify bottlenecks in your game or simulation and suggests practical optimizations.
NOTE::Unreal Insights currently doesn't support exporting stack traces to csvs. I'm looking into how to get around that.
